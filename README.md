# FIREBASE GET TOKEN

If you need a user Token from Firebase just for some tests and want to use just some test user this is what you want! (:

A simple HTML form that gets your Firebase config, a placeholder user and password and gets the token for you!

Just hit 'Get Token' and a new token (based on the placeholder user) will be fetched for you!

Placeholder user example:

- email: getTokenUser@fakemail.com
- password: qwe123
